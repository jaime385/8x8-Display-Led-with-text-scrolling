This is my first protect in GitHub and is about Arduino and scrolling text in a 8x8 display text.

Elaborating a proyect with a 8x8 led display and microcontrollers is a tricky thing. At least for me it's been that way, so I've started this proyect in order to help others with their similar proyects and with the following hardware:
1 - Arduino uno.
16 - Male-to-female wires.
1 - 8x8 led Display (Cathode).
